Calculating metabolite concentration from TopSpin integrals text document.

The concentrtaions of common metabolites found in bacteria growth media can be determined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy. The NMR spectra were analysed with TopSpin and the integrals were exported to a text document via the 'Integrate Spectra List' function. The NMR_Main_Script_2.py document takes the text documents as input and calculates the concentrations of each metabolite at the start and end of the fermentation period. The mean and standard deviation of replicate data is also calculated, plotted, and saved to an excel spreadsheet document.
